This program uses the Markov model to generate "random" text from the given text files. 
There are some example text files given, but any text file will work. The order for the
Markov can be chosen by the user with the given assumption that the order will not be 
greater than the amount of character or words in the text file chosen. The portion of 
the code that was coded by me is the code in map_model.cpp and word_model.cpp.
