The biggest challenge I encountered was formatting the words correctly for part two.
When I got to part 2's generate function, I didn't realize that the key i generated
for the next random word had an extra space in front of it, and when using a find()
function on the map, it would fail (because it wasn't the right string). Beyond that,
the project was relatively fun and easy, with the only thing I disliked about it
being that the initial instructions were a little hard to follow. I spent about 12
or more hours on this assignment.
